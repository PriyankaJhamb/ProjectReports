\section{Conclusion and Future Scope}
We have made a pilot implementation of the project E-transcript Management using Block-chain. In this, we are storing the transcripts on the block chain and each student can access only his/her certificates using amazing interface of website. Admin can upload the certificates in the block-chain using website page and maintain database of blocks in front of the username. If any university want to verify the certificate, student can send his/her personal hash with the university and verification can be done. Admin can add users through web page interface. Also each student need to login the website to check his/her certificates.

In future, we can build up for the college so that College can store the certificates securely on the block-chain and no one can alter any certificate because of the feature of block-chain. If anyone will do it, then it can be detected.  Verification of the certificates process will be fast in the future after using this project.
